# TEAM PROFILE GENERATOR

## PURPOSE
This is a Node CLI app that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. It prompts a user to input information about a team manager and then information about team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user. 

## USAGE
